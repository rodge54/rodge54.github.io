# Robert Rodgers Bio Website

## Week 1 Updates

- Created 5 html files, I went above and beyond by adding at least 5 semantic elements on each page, 
created 5 html files instead of 3, I added lists to every page, I added at least 2 images to 
every page (LinkedIn image at bottom), I added multiple external links.

## Week 2 Updates

- Added style.css and print.css style sheets.  Styled all pages to have matching headers, navbars, and footers.  Added a horizontal rule to html footer. Added some pictures to pull together some of the pages.  I spend a decent amount of time making the navbar responsive and figuring out how to position it.  I might make some changes later on to use flexgrid.
- I also added an additional contact me page.  It still needs some work on the styling and doesn't have functionality at this 
point.  Coming soon!

## Final Project Updates

- Added grid to all pages
- Added **strong** tags to education page.
- Added AJAX request to work.html page. The request pulls from assignments.json and populates the assignements list.  Added **strong** tag to bold the job portion of the list.
- Created a Rock Paper Scissors application using Vue.  This has it's own html, css, and js files so it is distinct from the rest of the website.
- Added form validation to Contact me page and added contact me navigation button
- Fixed a lot of styling and layout issues.
- Completed code refactoring and commenting.
