            Education was never really my thing growing up.  I rarely talked about going to college and when I did go to college
            I didn't care for it.  Once I joined the Air Force I realized education was extremely important to growth as a leader
            and airman.  I started off by taking a couple classes at the local college.  I didn't truly get serious about it until
            I decided I wanted to become a USAF Officer.  I completed my undergraduate degree in less than two years.  After that I 
            took some time off and decided to pursue a STEM degree.

            In 2018, a category 5 hurricane decimated my area.  We were sent out of the area and worked only when possible from home.
            During that time I got bored.  I wanted to build a website, but I didn't want to pay for it.  As I researched more and more 
            I realized the only way that could happen is if I learned html, css, and javascript.  So here I sit, a year and a half later 
            taking my final class for the Masters of Science in Software Development degree at Boston University.  P.S. This is my first 
            website.
