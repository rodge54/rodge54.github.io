        <h3>Things I need to do soon!</h3>
        <p>
            I have many goals personal and professional goals I would like to acheive over the next couple years.  
            The number one personal goal I have for 2020 is to complete my Masters in Software Development.  After the 
            class I am currently in I will have completed the entire Software Development program at Boston University.  
            Immediately following this course I would like to start some technology certifications to build my resume.  
            These certifications, in order, include:
