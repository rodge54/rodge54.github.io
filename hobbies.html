        <p id="hobbyPara1">
            I have always enjoyed building things and troubleshooting issues.  It may sound boring to some, but I really love 
            the satisfaction that comes from building something from nothing or fixing something that someone claims is broken.  
            On the weekends you will find me building something out of wood, working on a car/lawmower, programming, or fixing
            a broken computer.  I love being able to switch from having a tech-centric morning to getting my hands dirty in the 
            garage. 
        </p>

        <p id="hobbyPara2">
            Another passion of mine is functional exercise.  Currently I have my garage setup as half gym and half workshop.  
            I of course built my squat rack for my gym.  Having my home gym is great for times when I don't want to drive to the 
            gym or it is closed for some reason.  
        </p>

        <p id="hobbyPara3">
            Between working on tech, building things, exercising, and spending time with family I don't have time for much else.  
            I love it!
