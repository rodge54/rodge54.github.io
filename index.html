            Hello, my name is Robert Rodgers.  I was born and raised in a Southern Illinois.
            I loved growing up in Illinois, especially out in the country where I lived.  As a kid I was able
            to roam the neighborhood with no worries and I rode my bike everywhere I went.  Another huge benifit of 
            being in the country is that you can be as loud as you want.  When I was 13 years old my dad
            asked me if I wanted to race lawnmowers, naturally I said, "YES!!!" Over the next few years I 
            built and raced lawnmowers.  This taugt me a lot about mechanics and working hard to get what you 
            want.  After the first year, I won every race I was in. 
        </p>

        <p id="aboutPara2">
            During my childhood, I also played a lot of sports.  I played baseball, 
            football, basketball, ran track, and wrestled.  In highschool my focus was football and school was second.
            I started college in 2006 at a junior college.  I made it a semester and a half before an Army recruiter 
            showed up to my house.  Come to find out, my sister wanted an Army beanie from a magazine so she signed my
            name up to speak with a recruiter, because I was the only one 18 year old at the time.  I honestly thought 
            about joining the Army at that point, but my mom was not ok with that decision.  She called my brother, who
            was in the Air Force, and I recieved a phone call shortly after that.  He set me up with an Air Force recruiter
            and here I am 13 years later in the United States Air Force.
